# Basic Calculator

This is one of my **early projects** â€” a simple calculator I built around **1.5 years ago** when I was learning **web development**.  
It used **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with a clean **glassy UI design** and a modern gradient background.

## âœ¨ Features
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, âˆ’, Ã—, Ã·, %)
- Glassmorphism-inspired UI
- Lightweight and responsive
